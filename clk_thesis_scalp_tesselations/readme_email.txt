It's organized as follows:
./startup.m		- startup file to set path, etc.
./misc			- supporting files for plotting, statistics,
etc.
./surffreq		- thesis code to manipulate surfaces
./surffreq/test	- test code

Most of the matlab functions I wrote will display
a usage message if you run them without arguments.

I suggest you start by looking at the matlab files in ./surffreq/test;
they should show you how to setup and use the applicable
stuff in ./surffreq.

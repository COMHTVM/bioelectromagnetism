<H1>pvconv.pl - a Bruker data converter</H1>This page very briefly describes a 
program - pvconv.pl - that converts <A 
href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/brukerformat.html">Bruker format</A> 
MRI data to <A 
href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/analyze_fmt.html">Analyze image 
format</A>. It may also convert Bruker data to MINC format. 
<P>The program is based on the <A 
href="http://www.cmr.uq.edu.au/~rotor/software/">converters by Andrew Janke</A>; 
many thanks to him for the original programs and helpful suggestions. 
<P>See the <A href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/pvconv_pod.html">pvconv 
help</A> for pvconv features and usage. This help information is also available 
by running pvconv from the command line thus: 
<P><PRE>pvconv.pl -help  (help summary)
pvconv.pl -help -verbose (more extensive)
pvconv.pl -man   (full documentation)
</PRE>
<H2>Installing</H2>The program is written entirely in perl. You will need a 
working version of perl 5 on your system. To install, download the latest 
version of the pvconv archive from the <A 
href="ftp://ftp.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/pub/imaging/Pvconv">pvconv ftp directory</A>. 
Unpack it into a temporary directory. You now have three programs, "pvconv.pl", 
"pvshow.pl", and "brk2mat.pl" and two directories, "Bruker" and "Data". Copy the 
two directories to a directory on your perl library path. You may need to edit 
the top line of the .pl programs to make sure they can find your version of 
perl. At the moment the top line reads: <PRE>#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w</PRE>. If your version of perl is not at this 
path, change it to the correct path. You may be able to find your copy of perl 
with "which perl" from the Unix prompt. Then copy the pvconv.pl, pvshow.pl, 
brk2mat.pl program files to somewhere on your executable path. 
<P>You next need to install the <A 
href="http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/ULPFR/Math-Matrix-0.4.tar.gz">MathMatrix 
0.4 perl package</A>. See <A href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/INSTALL.html">the 
CPAN module install instructions</A>. 
<H2>Time series files</H2>If there are many time points in the data - e.g. for 
FMRI, then the analyze image that results will be a 4D file (x,y,z, time). You 
may want to use the <A 
href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/ana4dto3d.html">ana4dto3d</A> program 
to convert the 4D image to separate 3D volumes for each time point. 
<H2><A name=brk2mat>Remaking .mat files from Bruker data</A></H2>If you have 
previously converted your Bruker data, still have the <A 
href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/brukerformat.html">Bruker</A> text 
files, and just want to create the <A 
href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/spm_format.html#matfile">.mat 
files</A> for those data, you can use the brk2mat.pl program, which is in the 
same archive as pvconv. 
<P>pvconv creates a text file "image.brkhdr" which is the concatenation of all 
the Bruker text files for the image. You will need to create this file if pvconv 
has not done it for you, using something like this (3 is the run number you 
want, "brukerdirectory" is the Bruker data directory for this scanning session): 
<PRE>cd brukerdirectory/3
cat ../subject imnd acqp pdata/1/reco &gt; image.brkhdr
</PRE>- or put all these files into the same file with a text editor. 
<P>Now, you can create a .mat file from this .brkhdr file, with: <PRE>brk2mat.pl image.brkhdr
</PRE>which results in a .mat file "image.mat". 
<H2><A name=pvshow>Showing parameters for runs in a Bruker session</A></H2>If 
you want to see the scan names, session numbers and number of repetitions for 
all the files in a Bruker data directory, use pvshow.pl which is in the same 
archive as the other programs. Here is some example output: <PRE>pvshow.pl 000054-m04.ci1/ -all

</PRE>
<H2>The End</H2>I hope this converter is useful to you. If you have any 
problems, please email me (address below) and I will try and help. I will 
probably ask for a tarred archive of a Bruker data directory (a directory that 
contains a single scanning session) with the data giving the problem. You might 
want to remove the FID files from the archive, as they are not used by pvconv, 
and take up a large amount of space.

<H1>Bruker data format</H1>This is a short page briefly introducing the Bruker 
data format. The format is illustrated in the following graphic: 
<P><IMG src="Bruker data format_files/bruker_format.gif"> 
<P>For the Bruker format, a single scanning session is stored in its own 
directory. The directory is named according to the subject name or number, as 
typed in by the scanner operator. The directory name usually specifies the 
subject name/number and which session this is for that subject. Thus, a typical 
directory name would be <PRE>010005-m00.5X1</PRE>
<P>where '010005' is the WBIC subject number of the subject, the 00 of 'm00' 
means this is the first scanning session that subject has had at the WBIC (m01 
would be the second session), and '.5X1' is a code specifying the day of the 
study (5X) and the number of the session for that subject, on that day (1). The 
first two letters specify the day, since some arbitrary base date - set in the 
Bruker software (thanks to Andrew Janke for help on the code system). 
<P>The WBIC number (e.g. 010005) is turn is made up of the year the subject was 
first scanned (01 = 2001) and where that subject is in the sequence of new 
numbers allocated (5 = 5th subject in the year 2001 who has needed a new subject 
number). 
<P>This data directory (e.g 010005-m00.5X1) is in turn stored initially in the 
account space of the account for which the data was collected. For example, for 
scans collected using the cbu account, the data is stored in: 
<P><PRE>/imports/pvData0/cbu/nmr</PRE>on the WBIC system, but data collected with 
the 'guest' account is stored in: 
<P><PRE>/imports/pvData1/guest/nmr</PRE>
<P>Within the session directory (e.g 010005-m00.5X1), there are: 
<OL>
  <LI>a text file, named 'subject' (<A 
  href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/subject.txt">example subject 
  file</A>) 
  <LI>A subdirectory numbered 1, 2, 3 etc, for each saved run of data 
  acquisition in that session </LI></OL>
<P>Within each of the run directories (e.g. 010005-m00.5X1/5) there are the 
following: 
<OL>
  <LI>an 'imnd' text file (<A 
  href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/imnd.txt">imnd example</A>), 
  containing parameters used in setting up and acquiring the data from the 
  scanner 
  <LI>an 'acqp' (ACquisition Parameter) text file (<A 
  href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/acqp.txt">acqp example</A>), with 
  further details of the acquisition parameters used for that run 
  <LI>an large 'fid' file, that contains the raw, unreconstructed MR Free 
  Induction Decay data 
  <LI>a subdirectory 'pdata' (Processed Data), that contains any reconstructions 
  of the data into images 
  <LI>various other files, including the 'pulseprogram' and 'grdprog.r' gradient 
  programs </LI></OL>
<P>Within each of the 'pdata' subdirectories (e.g 01001-m00.5X1/5/pdata), there 
are numbered subdirectories (1,2,3 etc) for each new reconstruction of the raw 
data into images. There is usually only one such reconstruction, in subdirectory 
'1'. 
<P>Within each reconstruction directory (e.g 01001-m00.5X1/5/pdata/1), there 
are: 
<OL>
  <LI>a '2dseq' file. This is the 3D (structural etc) or 4D (FMRI) image file. 
  It is simply a binary block of data, which could simply be renamed as 
  'myscan.img' to make an acceptable Analyze .img file (see the <A 
  href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/analyze_fmt.html">Analyze format 
  page</A>). 
  <LI>a 'reco' text file (<A 
  href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/reco.txt">reco example</A>), 
  containing some details of the reconstruction. 
  <LI>a 'meta' text file (<A 
  href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/meta.txt">meta example</A>), which 
  I think contains information for the display of the 2dseq file within 
  ParaVision 
  <LI>a 'd3proc' file, containing image size definition parameters, inter alia. 
  </LI></OL>

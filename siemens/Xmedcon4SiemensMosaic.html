<H1>Converting Siemens' "Mosaic" files with medcon</H1>
<P>(Sorry for the poor layout)</P>
<H3>What is the mosaic format</H3>
<P>From what a Philipps engineer told me DICOM is supposed to be able to handle 
3 and 4dimensional data eventually (xmedcon can handle 3 dim data in several 
slices in one file). But there is no conformance statement out (which I think is 
not a real reason since none of the producers feel too obligated to any 
standard) so at the moment only one slice per file is DICOM standard.</P>
<P>Siemens built a format formally complying to the standard by setting the 
slices together in one plane.</P>
<H3>Why this web page</H3>
<P>Even though the Siemens' idea was/is good, it was problematic converting the 
data into other formats. While (X)medcon did a great job in converting normal 
1slice/1file data it couldn't handle mosaic data. So I took the libmdc from 
medcon put a hack around it and could convert mosaic files. This wild hack was 
put proberly into medcon by Eric Nolf (thanks a lot) around April 2001. 
Everything was fine.</P>
<P>After a discussion in the spm-mailing list I couldn't be nice and quiet 
(having a solution for my own data) but had to write to everybody why they 
didn't use the solution medcon gave them. They sent me some data. Needles to say 
Siemens created a whole new version of their mosaic DICOM files :-((((</P>
<H3>Patches that might work</H3>
<P>I created a patch which is a diff to the sources of xmedcon-0.7.5. just unzip 
it in your source-directory with</P>
<P>"patch -p1 <A 
href="http://neuro.psychologie.uni-oldenburg.de/~rutschmann/mosaic_html/xmedcon-mosaic.diff.gz">xmedcon-mosaic.diff</A>" 
do and recompile. If you don't like the compiler I have a <A 
href="http://neuro.psychologie.uni-oldenburg.de/~rutschmann/mosaic_html/medcon">static 
linux binary</A> of medcon here. Please test and give me some feedback (I don't 
expect everything to work right now)</P>
<P>While for my dicom-files (Vision, SPI Rel.1) the “-mosaic” option does 
automaticly find the number of slices and if the recording was ascending, 
descending or interlaced, I haven't found a tag in the new example I got (Sonata 
Numaris 4). I hope I found the right thing for getting the dimensions but 
haven't got a clue about where the information of how many slices where recorded 
and if they were interlaced is hidden. You have to correct manually with the 
"-e" option. (e.g. for the example I got there were 21 slices in a 5x5 matrix so 
you would convert to analize like this “medcon -c anlz -e '1...21' -f 
myfile.ima” for interlaced files do something like '-e 1 5 2 6 3 ....' depending 
on the number and order of slices)</P>
<H3>How can I help (and get an easy solution with the next patch)</H3>
<OL>
  <LI>
  <P>If you want to convert your mosaic files in one step with medcon do the 
  following:</P>
  <LI>
  <P>Download and install xmedcon from <A 
  href="http://xmedcon.sourceforge.net/">http://xmedcon.sourceforge.net/</A> and 
  install:</P>
  <LI>
  <P>Convert your files using medcon and the "-mosaic" version. If that worked 
  continue at 5.</P>
  <LI>
  <P>If it didn't work get the <A 
  href="http://neuro.psychologie.uni-oldenburg.de/~rutschmann/mosaic_html/xmedcon-mosaic.diff.gz">patch</A> 
  or the patched <A 
  href="http://neuro.psychologie.uni-oldenburg.de/~rutschmann/mosaic_html/medcon">medcon 
  binary</A> and try again.</P>
  <LI>
  <P>Do medcon -f myfile. You get something like:</P></LI></OL>
<P>FILE 001 : dic3.ima FORMAT: DICOM </P>

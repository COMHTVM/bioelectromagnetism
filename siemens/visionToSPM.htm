      <H3><BR>What is the benefit when converting *.imas to SPM with visionToSPM 
      ?<BR></H3><BR>
      <P>The basic idea of this tool is preserve all the information 
      (orientation/position of a volume scan too) that is contained in the raw 
      image files (*.imas) when the data is transformed to the analyse-format 
      used by SPM. This can make a coregistration of anatomical and functional 
      data in SPM-preprocessing dispensable:</P>
      <P>If the experimental scanning-procedure ensures that the first 
      functional image is recorded immediately after the anatomical scan 
      (MPRage, FLASH) has finished, a perfect coregistration between anatomical 
      and functional data is obtained by transforming the orientation/position 
      of the scans to the SPM-world too and realigning all the functional images 
      onto the first functional scan.</P>
      <P><BR><BR></P>
      <H3>When can I use visionToSPM ?</H3>
      <P><BR>First at all you need to have recorded your functional data with an 
      SIEMENS Magnetom vision scanner. Image files must be in ACR-NEMA file 
      format (*.ima), not DICOM (this would be a nice extension to the tool. If 
      you add it - <A href="mailto:s_thees@yahoo.com">inform me</A> please 
      !).</P>
      <P>There is no experience with other MR-scanner from SIEMENS at the 
      moment. But I suppose that even on a SIEMENS Symphony or something similar 
      it will not work without some adjustments.</P>
      <P>Second the tool is tested only for a few sequences (MPRage, T1_se_fast, 
      EPI_mosaic). The basic problem is that there is no documentation of raw 
      image file format provided by SIEMENS. Thus the parameters needed by 
      visionToSPM may read from the wrong place in header, when using other 
      sequences. In this case you must enter some parameters manually (see 
      below).<BR><BR><BR></P>
      <H3>Installation<BR><BR></H3>
      <P>Make the directory visionToSPM in your matlab-working space and unzip 
      the files into this directory. 
      <P><BR>Add this directory to the path in matlab<BR><BR><BR><BR>
      <H3>Running the program</H3>
      <P><BR>Let us assume you would like to transform an anatomical volume scan 
      (MPRage) recorded first and a functional session (EPI_mosaic) recorded 
      subsequently. We assume further that the subject has not moved his head 
      between the anatomical and the functional scan !<BR><BR><BR></P>
      <P>start the tool by typing: 
      <I><B>visionToSPM<BR><BR></B></I><B><BR>A)</B> conversion of the 
      anatomical data:<BR><BR>Choose from <I><B>select ima type</B></I> the item 
      normal (anatomical) and enter a name for the output file. If the slices 
      were scanned interleaved select it (you MUST have used top to bottom 
      interleaved mode !).</P>
      <P>From the menu <I><B>file</B></I> choose <I><B>select ima files</B></I>. 
      To select the images select one of the image files and click OK. 
      visionToSPM selects all the files that are numbered continiously in the 
      last number of the filename. If the number of file visionToSPM founds is 
      correct, click yes. If not, check whether al the ima-files of the volume 
      scan are in the directory.</P>
      <P><B>Check </B>whether the scan-parameters given in the left frame are 
      correct. If not check <I><B>enter Ima parameters manually</B></I> and 
      enter those parameters which are wrong by your own (the image displayed on 
      the right is the one you selected before).</P>
      <P>Choose the information that sould be transformed (bitmaps ad geometry, 
      bitmaps only or geometry only) and start the conversion. Three files named 
      as output-Filename.hdr, output-Filename.img and output-Filename.mat are 
      generated.<BR><BR><BR><B>B)</B> conversion of the functional 
      data:<BR><BR>Choose from <I><B>select ima type</B></I> the item mosaic 
      (EPI). If the slices were scanned interleaved select it (you MUST have 
      used top to bottom interleaved mode !).</P>
      <P>When converting the functional data the <B><I>mat-file prefix</I></B> 
      determines after which step of the preprocessing in SPM ( a=slicetiming, 
      ra=realigning, nra=normalization or snra=smoothing) the geometrical 
      information (orientation/position) obtained from the raw image files is 
      added to the flow of data-processing. In particular if you plan to use the 
      spm_batch tool this must be 'ra'.</P>
      <P></P>
      <P>Now, from the menu <I><B>file</B></I> choose <I><B>select ima 
      files</B></I>. To select the volume-scans of a session select one of the 
      volume-scans and click OK. If the <B><I>imaType</I></B> is mosaic, 
      visionToSPM selects all the files that are numbered continiously in the 
      last two numbers of the filename.</P>
      <P>Again, check whether the scan-parameters given are correct and enter 
      them manually if not.</P>
      <P><B><I>Start the conversion</I></B>. Three files per volume-scan will be 
      generated, a <B>*.hdr</B>, a <B>*.img</B> and a <B>ra*.mat</B> 
      file.<BR><BR></P><BR>
      <P>If you perform the preprocessing in SPM manually (not using spm_batch), 
      separate the ra*.mat files of the functional data from the *.hdr and *.img 
      files by moving them into a different directory before you start with 
      preprocessing in SPM. Now perform slice-timing and realigning (coregister 
      &amp; reslice). After realigning copy the ra*.mat files generated by 
      visionToSPM into the directory of the ra*.img and ra*.hdr files.</P>
      <P>A coregistration between anatomical and functional data is now 
      obtained.</P>

<u><b><font color="#000044" size="+1">Introduction</font></b></u>
<br>
The biggest drawback to the NIfTI-1 format is the complete inability to
customize or extend the header.  The reasons for doing so are varied and
do not need to be discussed here.  This has been the major topic of
discussion on the <a href="http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/dfwg/phorum/">NIfTI-1 message board</a>.
This document contains my proposal (or rather, three nested proposals) for adding
extra header fields to the NIfTI-1 format.  <a href="#Other">At the end</a>, I'll also address briefly some of
the other issues that have been raised on the message board.
</p>

<p>
<u><b><font color="#000044" size="+1">Extension and Customization of the Header</font></b></u><br>
I propose a standard format for the "extra" header information that
can fit between byte offset 348 and <tt>vox_offset</tt> in a <tt>*.nii</tt>
file.  This format is an <a href="http://www.xml.com/axml/axml.html">XML</a>-ish
text format. The format described
below is simplified so as to be easy to parse without the use of a full
XML processor library.  It is also close enough to XML to be able to be
extracted bodily and incorporated into an XML document, with the addition
of an XML prolog and an enclosing XML element (start and end tags).
</p>

<p>
<b>Character Set</b>:<br>
The data in the extended header space will be in 8-bit text form
(no <a href="http://www.unicode.org/">Unicode</a> or
 <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/%7Emgk25/unicode.html">UTF-8</a>).
The character set will have the first 128 characters (lower 7 bits) be
<a href="http://czyborra.com/charsets/iso646.html">US-ASCII (ISO-646)</a>.
It would be legal to use one of the
<a href="http://czyborra.com/charsets/iso8859.html">ISO-8859-*</a>
character sets for non-English languages, but this might create some portability issues.
</p>

<p>
<b>Elements</b>:<br>
The extended header data will be formatted as a sequential
collection of <b>elements</b>.
(The term is derived from XML.
Unlike XML, an element may not contain another element, and there is no prolog.)
The format of an element is
</p><blockquote>
<tt>&lt;<i>NAME</i>&nbsp;<i>ATTRIBUTEs</i>&gt;&nbsp;<i>DATATEXT</i>&nbsp;&lt;/<i>NAME</i>&gt;</tt>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>or</b>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <tt>&lt;<i>NAME</i>&nbsp;<i>ATTRIBUTEs</i> /&gt;</tt>
</blockquote>
The second form can be used if the DATATEXT field is empty.
The words in uppercase italics are defined below:
<ul>
 <p>
 </p><li> <i><b>NAME</b></i>
 <ul> <li> The allowable characters in an element (or attribute) NAME are
           "<tt>A-Z</tt>", "<tt>a-z</tt>", "<tt>0-9</tt>",
           and the special characters underscore, period, colon, and hyphen
           ("<tt>_</tt>"&nbsp;&nbsp;"<tt>.</tt>"&nbsp;&nbsp;"<tt>:</tt>"&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;"<tt>-</tt>").
      </li><li> The first character in a NAME must be alphabetic.
      </li><li> The first whitespace or other non-NAME character found ends the NAME.
      </li><li> Whitespace is defined by NIfTI-1 (and by XML)
           to be the characters blank, newline, carriage-return, and horizontal tab.
      </li><li> The maximum legal length of a NAME is 255 characters.
      </li><li> The NAME that starts an element must immediately follow the opening "&lt;"
           character (no whitespace).  If an element ends with the
           construct "<tt>&lt;/<i>NAME</i>&gt;</tt>", the NAME that starts the element
           must also finish the element.
      </li><li> Some example NAMEs:
           <pre>             Z_zzza-...         legal
             _Ethel_            illegal (can't start with "_")
             In;the;beginning   illegal (can't use ";" in a NAME) </pre>
      </li><li> XML notes:
      <ul>
       <li> The characters that are allowed in a NAME are taken from the XML specification,
            restricted to the US-ASCII character set.
       </li><li> The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/">XML namespace specification</a>
            reserves the use of the colon in NAMEs for namespace identification.
            This concept is adopted and adapted (far) below for NIfTI-1 use.
       </li><li> XML allows NAMEs to start with underscore&nbsp;"_", but NIfTI-1 does not.
       </li><li> XML does not put a maximum length on a NAME.
      </li></ul>
  </li></ul>
 <p></p>

 <p>
 </p></li><li> <i><b>ATTRIBUTE</b></i> (optional)
 <ul> <li> Each ATTRIBUTE takes the form <i>NAME=STRING</i>, where <i>NAME</i> was defined
           above.
      </li><li> Multiple ATTRIBUTES in an element header
           must be separated by one or more whitespace characters.
      </li><li> The element header ends at the first "<tt>&gt;</tt>" character following the element NAME.
      </li><li> The "=" character separating the attribute name from its string value may optionally
           be surrounded by whitespace.
      </li><li> A <b><i>STRING</i></b> is enclosed in matching quote characters,
           either "double quotes" or 'single quotes'.   The following XML escape sequences
           can be used to represent certain characters inside STRINGs:
            <blockquote><table border="2" cellpadding="3">
            <tbody><tr> <td><b>Escape</b></td>       <td><b>Translation</b>          </td> <td><b>Note</b></td> </tr>
            <tr> <td><tt>&amp;lt;</tt></td>   <td><tt>&lt;</tt> (less than)   </td> <td>Required</td> </tr>
            <tr> <td><tt>&amp;gt;</tt></td>   <td><tt>&gt;</tt> (greater than)</td> <td>Required</td> </tr>
            <tr> <td><tt>&amp;amp;</tt></td>  <td><tt>&amp;</tt> (ampersand)  </td> <td>Required</td> </tr>
            <tr> <td><tt>&amp;quot;</tt></td> <td><tt>"</tt>    (quote)       </td> <td>Optional</td> </tr>
            <tr> <td><tt>&amp;apos;</tt></td> <td><tt>'</tt>    (apostrophe)  </td> <td>Optional</td> </tr>
            </tbody></table></blockquote>
            Characters marked as "Required" can only be represented in a String by
            the escape sequence.  Characters marked as "Optional" can be represented
            by the escape or by themselves.  (Of course, to include a double quote character inside
            a string delimited by double quotes, the <tt>&amp;quot;</tt> escape would be required.)
      </li><li> Some example ATTRIBUTEs:
           <pre>              diffusion_bfactor="2407.3"
              command = "cat fred &amp;gt; 'ethel'" </pre>
      </li><li> XML notes:
      <ul>
        <li> XML requires that no two attributes in the same element have the same attribute name.
             NIfTI-1 does not enforce this requirement, but if you wish to produce well-formed XML
             elements, then you need to be aware of this restriction.
        </li><li> Other XML-defined escapes (such as "<tt>&amp;#x3A;</tt>"
             for insertion of a single character specified in hexadecimal)
             should not be used, since they are not required to be recognized by NIfTI-1
             processor software.
      </li></ul>
 </li></ul>
 <p></p>

 <p>
 </p></li><li> <i><b>DATATEXT</b></i> (optional)
 <ul> <li> The text between the <tt>&gt;</tt> that closes the element header and
           the <tt>&lt;/</tt> that closes the element can be almost any sequence of
           nonzero bytes.  (Remember that this information is supposed to be text.)
           Exceptions are the characters whose escapes are listed as "Required" in the
           table above.
      </li><li> If no DATATEXT is present (the element is "empty"), then
           the element can be in either of the forms
           <tt>&lt;NAME/&gt;</tt> &nbsp; <b>or</b> &nbsp; <tt>&lt;NAME&gt;&lt;/NAME&gt;</tt>.
      </li><li> XML note:
      <ul> <li> NIfTI-1 does <b>not</b> allow for CDATA, nested elements, entities, DTDs,
                and so forth.
      </li></ul>
 </li></ul>
 <p></p>
</li></ul>
<p></p>

<p>
<b>Rationale</b>:<br>
The choices above are guided by
the principle that the extended header stuff should be easy to parse.
For the truly lazy/amateur/hurried programmer, the following pseudo-algorithm would work
to extract the element NAME and DATATEXT (on well-formed elements):
</p><ol>
 <li> Start at byte offset #348.  Don't scan past byte offset <tt>vox_offset-1</tt>.
 </li><li> Scan forward until the "<tt>&lt;</tt>" character is found.
 </li><li> From the current scan position, scan until a non-NAME character is
      found.  You now have the element NAME.
 </li><li> Scan forward until the next "<tt>&gt;</tt>" character is found.
      If the character before that is "<tt>/</tt>", the data element is
      ended and there is no DATATEXT.  <b>Go&nbsp;back&nbsp;to&nbsp;2</b>.
 </li><li> Scan forward until the next "<tt>&lt;</tt>" character is found.
      DATATEXT is everything between the last "<tt>&gt;</tt>" and this "<tt>&lt;</tt>".
      <b>Go&nbsp;back&nbsp;to&nbsp;2.</b>
</li></ol>
Parsing attributes and expanding escapes is a little harder.  Perhaps attributes should not
be included in this revision.  On the other hand, attributes can be very useful.  See the
<b>Recap</b> section, below, for further discussion.
<p></p>

<p>
I chose to propose an XML-ish format for these header extensions because I think that
being able to extract this information into some external file/database may become
important in the future.  A&nbsp;simpler idea would be something of the form
<tt>NAME&nbsp;=&nbsp;STRING</tt>, which would be trivial to parse.  This was my
first idea, and is more-or-less equivalent to the simplest level of this proposal (cf.&nbsp;<b>Recap</b>).
But I actually favor including information about how to parse the <tt>STRING</tt>, which means
we need attributes, which leads straight to XML-land.
</p>

<p>
<b>Structured Elements</b>:<br>
As a higher level of organization, NIfTI-1 elements can contain attributes
that define how to interpret the DATATEXT as a 2D table of numbers.  To start with an
example:
</p><pre>  &lt;diffusion_encoding nifti:type="3*float" nifti:rows="4" &gt;
       2.3 7.2 9.4
       6.2 -3.1 -1.0
       0.2 6.7 9.8
       6.6 7.9 -88.3 &lt;/diffusion_encoding&gt;
</pre>
The <tt>nifti:type</tt> attribute specifies that DATATEXT is to be interpreted as
a sequence of sets of 3 floating point numbers; the <tt>nifti:rows</tt> attribute specifies
that there will be 4 such sets.  (The line breaks in the example are not required; arbitrary
whitespace can be used to separate numbers inside DATATEXT.)
A&nbsp;more complicated example mixes numeric types:
<pre>  &lt;node_rgb nifti:type='int,3*float' nifti:rows='5'&gt;
           7 0.8 0.1 0.9  11 0.0 0.1 0.9  17 0.9 0.9 0.0
          23 0.9 0.7 0.7  31 0.2 0.9 0.9
   &lt;/node_rgb&gt;
</pre>
Here, each "row" of values is to comprise 1 int and 3 floats, and there are 5 "rows".
<p></p>

<p>
The elementary types allowed in the <tt>nifti:type</tt> ATTRIBUTE
would be <tt>int</tt>, <tt>float</tt>, <tt>complex</tt>,
and <tt>String</tt>.  This last type would be a way to encode a integer-string
labeling table:
</p><pre>  &lt;label_table nifti:type="int,String" nifti:rows="4&gt;
     1 "Hippocampus"   2 "Amygdala"  3 "Brodmann 42"  4 "Who Knows?" &lt;/label_table&gt;
</pre>
The only reason <b>not</b> to allow a <tt>String</tt> type would be to minimize the
parsing effort.  On the other hand, if ATTRIBUTEs are included in NIfTI-1, then the code
for parsing them would be reusable for parsing the DATATEXT Strings.
<p></p>

<p>
<b>Standard Attribute</b>:<br>
A standard attribute can be defined to incorporate the information from the binary
header.  For example:
</p><pre>  &lt;nifti_image
    nifti_type = 'NIFTI-1+'
    header_filename = 'elvis.nii'
    image_filename = 'elvis.nii'
    image_offset = '-1'
    ndim = '3'
    nx = '64' ny = '64' nz = '21'
    dx = '4' dy = '4' dz = '6'
    datatype = '4' datatype_name = 'INT16'
    nvox = '86016'
    nbyper = '2'
    byteorder = 'LSB_FIRST'
    cal_min = '3' cal_max = '25500'
    freq_dim = '1' phase_dim = '2' slice_dim = '3'
    slice_start = '0' slice_end = '20' slice_duration = '5.5' slice_code = '3'
    xyz_units = '2' time_units = '8'
    qform_code = '1' quatern_b = '0.7' quatern_c = '0' quatern_d = '0'
    qoffset_x = '0' qoffset_y = '0' qoffset_z = '0' qfac = '1'
  /&gt;</pre>
Other layouts could be designed.  The <tt>image_offset</tt> value of <tt>-1</tt>
is intended to signal that the image data occurs flush to the end of the file;
that is, the offset should be computed by examining the length of the file,
then subtracting the number of bytes that the image data occupies (<tt>nvox*nbyper</tt>).
<p></p>

<p>
<b>Namespaces (of a sort)</b>:<br>
To prevent overlap in element names between different developers,
there are two non-exclusive possible ways to proceed.
Both methods would make a NAME be of the form "<tt>prefix:suffix</tt>".
The prefix part would be used to distinguish the originator of the NAME.
(The use of a colon to separate NAMEs into distinct pieces is compatible with the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/">XML namespace idea</a>, and is partly
where I got the idea.)
</p>

<p>
The first method is to have a central "registry" for name prefixes (presumably the
nifti.nimh.nih.gov site), and start off with some pre-defined prefixes such as
<tt>afni:</tt>, <tt>brainvoyager:</tt>, <tt>caret:</tt>, <tt>dicom:</tt>, <tt>freesurfer:</tt>,
<tt>fsl:</tt>, <tt>mni:</tt>, <tt>nifti:</tt>, and&nbsp;<tt>spm:</tt>
(and anything else at all popular).  Anyone who wants a new prefix assigned can ask.
I&nbsp;don't think the demand will be too high, so that maintaining the registry
would be a low-key activity.
</p>
<p>
The second method is for each site to
use as a prefix some unique fully qualified domain name from their institution,
such as <tt>nimh.nih.gov:</tt>.  The advantage of the second way is that no
central registry is needed.  The disadvantage is that NAMEs will be longer.
</p>

<p>
As an example, DICOM attributes could be included in a NIfTI-1 extended header with
elements of the form
</p><pre>  &lt;dicom:0020_0037 nifti:type="6*float"&gt;
    0.984808 0.173648 0.0 -0.173648 0.984808 0.0 &lt;/dicom:0020_0037&gt;
</pre>
(This particular example is the "Image Orientation (Patient)" DICOM field.)
<p></p>

<p>
<b>Recap</b>:<br>
There are 3 levels to this extended header proposition:
</p><ol>
 <li> Simple elements of the form <tt>&lt;NAME&gt;&nbsp;DATATEXT&nbsp;&lt;/NAME&gt;</tt>
      or <tt>&lt;NAME/&gt;</tt>,
      with no attributes.  These are easiest to parse.  Namespaces are part of this
      level of the proposal.
 </li><li> Add attributes, but don't have any NIfTI-1 defined meaning for any of them.
 </li><li> Add the <tt>nifti:type</tt> and <tt>nifti:rows</tt> attributes to give a
      standardized way to specify the interpretation of the DATATEXT part of an element.
</li></ol>
I can provide a C implementation of any of these levels.  This proposal is a simplified
version of the NIML protocol/format that is already implemented in the AFNI+SUMA package,
and so incorporating it to the NIfTI-1 sample code will be relatively easy.
<p></p>

<p>
Finally, the extended header is designed to supplement the NIfTI-1 binary header,
not replace it.  Applications should be able to skip the extended header entirely and
still be able to read the image data.  Applications that do use the extended header
should be prepared to deal with (e.g.,&nbsp;ignore) elements with which they are
not familiar.

<p>
<u><b><font color="#000044" size="+1">Other Issues</font></b></u>
<br>
Other issues that have come up on the NIfTI-1 message board include:
</p><ul>
 <li><p>
     <b>Compressed image data</b>: 2D image files are usually compressed, so why
      not 3-5D files?  The answer is simplicity: the format is intended
     to be simple and I/O easily implemented by a "reasonable" programmer in a
     "reasonable" time in various languages.  Nothing prevents a programmer from
     storing a <tt>*.nii</tt> file in <tt>gzip</tt>-ed form (e.g.,&nbsp;<tt>fred.nii.gz</tt>),
     detecting this from the filename, and decompressing it during input.  But the
     burden of supporting compression should not be present in every program.
     </p>

 </li><li><p>
     <b>Endian-ness</b>: The byte ordering of the header and image data is to be inferred
     from the <tt>dim[0]</tt> header field; there is no explicit byte ordering flag.
     Some would argue for a fixed byte order for the header, others for an explicit flag.
     These are minor points, and I don't think the NIfTI-1 format needs to be changed
     in this area.
     </p>

 </li><li><p>
     <b>DICOM?</b>: The idea of using DICOM is still floating around.  The reasons why
     not are simple: DICOM is <i>too</i> layered and rococo to meet the "reasonable" test
     described above.  For example, after 2 hours of reading, I still cannot figure out how
     to determine the 3D orientation of a multi-slice (Supplement&nbsp;49) DICOM file.
     I'm sure it is in there somewhere, but if this minor factoid can't be deciphered in
     2 hours, then the format and its documentation is too intricate.
     </p>

 </li><li><p>
     <b><tt>orient</tt> <i>vs.</i> <tt>qform_code</tt></b>:  The ANALYZE-7.5 format indicated
     3D orientation with the 1 byte code <tt>orient</tt>, which was to be interpreted as
     </p><blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="2">
       <tbody><tr> <td>0 = transverse-unflipped</td> <td><tt>  R&#8594;L P&#8594;A I&#8594;S</tt></td></tr>
       <tr> <td>1 = coronal-unflipped</td>    <td><tt>  R&#8594;L I&#8594;S P&#8594;A</tt></td></tr>
       <tr> <td>2 = sagittal-unflipped</td>   <td><tt>  P&#8594;A I&#8594;S R&#8594;L</tt></td></tr>
       <tr> <td>3 = transverse-flipped</td>   <td><tt>  R&#8594;L A&#8594;P I&#8594;S</tt></td></tr>
       <tr> <td>4 = coronal-flipped</td>      <td><tt>  R&#8594;L S&#8594;I P&#8594;A</tt></td></tr>
       <tr> <td>5 = sagittal-flipped</td>     <td><tt>  P&#8594;A I&#8594;S L&#8594;R</tt></td></tr>
     </tbody></table></blockquote>
     NIfTI-1 uses the 2 byte <tt>qform_code</tt> (which overlaps with <tt>orient</tt>)
     and the quaternion values <tt>quatern_b</tt>, <tt>quatern_c</tt>, <tt>quatern_d</tt>
     to indicate the general orientation in 3D (plus <tt>pixdim[0]</tt> when the image
     axes aren't right-handed).
    <p></p>

    <p>It was proposed to keep the <tt>orient</tt> code values to indicate orientations
       that are orthogonal to the subject anatomical axes, and modify the <tt>qform_code</tt>
       values to allow for these values.  In principal, I&nbsp;am not opposed to this idea,
       although it would make the application programs more complicated: they would now have
       to deal with 3 different orientation-specifying methods (quaternion, general matrix,
       and discrete flips).  However, an application can detect the presence of flips by
       examining the values of the quaternion parameters; for example, <tt>(b,c,d)=(1,0,0)</tt>
       is a 180<sup>o</sup> flip around the <i>x</i>-axis.  Thus, if a programmer wants to
       write a special purpose flipping function (for speed) when the orientation is special,
       the information needed to decide when this is possible is already present.
    </p>

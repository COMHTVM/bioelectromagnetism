<H1>Advanced EMMA Image Manipulation</H1>

This tutorial covers advanced image manipulation using MATLAB and the
EMMA toolkit.  It assumes that the reader already has a familiarity
with EMMA and basic image manipulation.  If not, please see the <A
HREF="emma1.html">basic EMMA image manipulation</A> tutorial.

<H3>Creating and Using a Mask</H3>

Let's start by assuming that we have loaded 21 frames from one slice
of a dynamic PET study into a variable called <TT>PET</TT>.  We want
to create a mask that contains 1's where the brain is, and 0's
everywhere else.  If this is an oxygen study, one simple approach is
to integrate the image over time, and then choose values for mask
pixels by using a threshold.  We can calculate the integrated image
the same way as we did in the <A HREF="emma1.html">basic EMMA
image manipulation</A> tutorial.  Assuming a variable called
<TT>ftimes</TT> that contains the mid-frame times of the frames:

<PRE>
img = ntrapz(ftimes,PET')';
</PRE>

is the integrated image.  We now wish to choose pixels for the mask.
MATLAB is able to perform boolean operations on a vector of values, so
this is very easy:

<PRE>
mask = img>(mean(img)*threshold);
</PRE>

In this case, pixels in <TT>mask</TT> will be set to 1 if the value of
the integrated image is greater than the mean of the entire image
times some threshold.  To create a mask that masks out everything
except brain, we would generally choose a threshold of one (all pixels
in the integrated image that have a value greater than the mean of the
integrated image are chosen):

<PRE>
mask = img>(mean(img));
</PRE>

This produces an image that looks like:

<P>This mask can be easily applied to the original images by simply
multiplying the two together:

<PRE>
masked_frame = PET(:,17) .* mask;
</PRE>

This will produce a masked version of frame 17, which looks like:

<H3>Averaging a Set of Images</H3>

When performing a PET study, a set of data from several subjects is usually
collected.  Once all of the data is collected, the data from the various
separate studies must be averaged together.  MATLAB allows math to be
performed on images in a very straight forward way.  Assuming that we have a
set of images stored in variables <TT>P1</TT>, <TT>P2</TT>, <TT>P3</TT>,
<TT>P4</TT>, and that we wish to average these four images, the result is
simply:

<PRE>
average_image = (P1+P2+P3+P4)/4;
</PRE>

<H3>Producing Time Activity Curves</H3>

Time activity curves are very simple to produce using MATLAB.  EMMA provides a
function called <TT>maketac</TT> that given the x and y coordinates of a
point, and a set of dynamic PET images, will return a time-activity curve
based on a 5 pixel square region of interest (ROI).  The methods used in the
<TT>maketac</TT> function can be extended to any size/shape ROI.  One example
of its use is:

<PRE>
viewimage(img);
[x,y]=getpixel(1);
tac = maketac(x,y,PET);
figure;
plot(ftimes,tac);
</PRE>

The first line displays the integrated image (calculated previously), the
second line prompts the user to click on a point in the image (returning the x
and y coordinates of the point), the third line creates the time activity
curve and saves it in the variable <TT>tac</TT>, and the last two lines create
a plot of the curve (remember that <TT>ftimes</TT> contains the mid-frame
times, retrieved previously).  The resulting plot might look something like
this:

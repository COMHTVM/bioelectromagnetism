<H2>Region of Interest (ROI) Analysis Using MATLAB and EMMA</H2>

There are existing packages at the MNI for performing ROI analysis,
the foremost of which is <TT>roi</TT>.  However, none of these was
designed to work explicitly with MATLAB.   Since much analysis is
currently being done within the MATLAB environment, a ROI package was
developed for MATLAB.  The package consists of the following MATLAB
functions:

<UL>
<LI> <TT>drawboxroi</TT>    - Draw a simple box ROI on a figure
<LI> <TT>drawpolyroi</TT>   - Draw a general polygonal ROI on a figure
<LI> <TT>drawroi</TT>       - Draws a given ROI on a given figure
<LI> <TT>getroi</TT>        - Get the normalized vertices of a ROI 
<LI> <TT>makeroimask</TT>   - Create a mask from a set of ROIs
<LI> <TT>transferroi</TT>   - Copies ROIs from one figure to another
</UL>

Use of this package is reasonably straight forward.  The following
short example demonstrates the use of the ROI package for creating a
mask to be applied to PET images:

<PRE>
>> h=openimage('kunl1_avg.mnc')
>> PET=getimages(h,8);
>> closeimage(h);
>> h=openimage('kunl1_mrirsl_21.mnc');
>> MRI=getimages(h,8);
>> viewimage(MRI);
>> drawpolyroi;
Click on the vertices of the ROI...
Click outside the figure to quit
>> mask=makeroimask(1,2,[128 128]);
>> figure
>> viewimage(mask.*PET);
</PRE>

In this example, we load a PET image and an MRI image (which have been
registered to each other and resampled so that slice 8 of one
corresponds to slice 8 of the other).  The MRI slice is displayed, and
the <TT>drawpolyroi</TT> function is called to create an ROI.  Once
the ROI has been drawn, a 128x128 mask is created, and this is applied
to the PET image.

<P>
This same technique could be applied for the creation of any number of
ROIs on a single slice, and then all of the ROIs could be included in
a single mask.

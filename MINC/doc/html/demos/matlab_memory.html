<TITLE>Controlling MATLAB Memory Use</TITLE>
<H1>Controlling MATLAB Memory Use</H1>


MATLAB is a very useful tool for analysing medical image data.
Unfortunately, it has one significant drawback: MATLAB memory
management is terrible.  The memory becomes easily fragmented, with no
attempts made at compaction (except for the almost useless MATLAB
<TT>pack</TT> function).  With large medical image volumes, the
results can be disastrous, leading to huge memory use, poor
performance, and in the extreme case the termination of your MATLAB
process by the operating system.

<P>Controlling MATLAB memory use is a bit of a black art.  There are
general guidelines that can be followed, but no hard and fast rules
that will work in every case.  Here are some soft rules:

<OL> 

<LI> Re-use memory whenever possible.  For example, the EMMA
<TT>getimages</TT> function allows you to specify a block of memory to
use.  In general, this is the variable that already contains an image,
and should be the same size as the images to be loaded:

<PRE>
PET = getimages(h,8,1:21,PET);
</PRE>

will re-use the memory assigned to the matrix PET, and will not
allocate new memory for the returned images.  This eliminates the
fragmentation associated with reloading a set of images.

<P><LI> Use the EMMA <TT>rescale</TT> function to multiply matrices by a
scalar.  This function does not assign new memory, but instead uses
the memory already assigned to the matrix.  For example, the MATLAB
instruction:

<PRE>
PET = PET .* 5;
</PRE>

will cause fragmentation since the matrix PET will be copied.
However, the instruction:

<PRE>
rescale (PET,5);
</PRE>

has the same effect, but without causing fragmentation.

<P><LI> Initialize large matrices.  This is useful when you intend to
fill a matrix slowly through a series of operations.  For example, if
you intended to create a 128x128 image one row at a time in the
variable <TT>Fake_PET</TT>, you should specify:

<PRE>
Fake_PET = zeros(128,128);
</PRE>

This will initialize the matrix to the correct size, and fill it with
zeros.  Then, when you fill the matrix in with your values, it will
not be copied, and memory fragmentation will not occur.

<P><LI> Use small amounts of memory at a time.  This is probably the
<I>most important rule</I>, and can potentially solve all memory use
problems.  For example, when analyzing a dynamic study, consider
breaking down your analysis so that it can be performed on one line
(or several lines) at a time, instead of on the whole image.

</OL>

For example consider the case presented in the <A
HREF="emma1.html">basic EMMA image manipulation</A> tutorial: we want
to generate a volume of integrated images.  The following snippet of
code demonstrates the wrong way to do this:

<PRE>
h=openimage('/local/matlab/toolbox/emma/examples/yates_19445.mnc');
h2 = newimage('new.mnc',[0 15], ...
     '/local/matlab/toolbox/emma/examples/yates_19445.mnc');

ftimes = getimageinfo (h,'MidFrameTimes');

img = zeros (16384,1);

for j=1:15
   PET = getimages(h,j,1:21);
   img = ntrapz(ftimes,PET')';
   putimages(h2,img,j);
end;

closeimage(h);
closeimage(h2);
</PRE>

This brute force technique violates several of the above guidelines.
It does not re-use memory when loading images from the MINC file.  It
transposes <TT>PET</TT>, which causes <TT>PET</TT> to be copied.  It
then transposes the result from <TT>ntrapz</TT>, which causes this
result to be copied.

<P>A better approach is to load the images for one slice, take the
data line by line, and then re-assemble this into a final image.  The
following piece of MATLAB code has the same final result as the above,
but uses much less memory (approximately 4 Megabytes).

<PRE>
h=openimage('/local/matlab/toolbox/emma/examples/yates_19445.mnc');
h2 = newimage('new.mnc',[0 15], ...
     '/local/matlab/toolbox/emma/examples/yates_19445.mnc');

ftimes = getimageinfo (h,'MidFrameTimes');

img = zeros (16384,1);

for j=1:15
   PET = getimages(h,j,1:21,PET);
   for i=1:128:16257;
      line = PET(i:i+127,:);
      img (i:i+127) = ntrapz(ftimes, line')';
   end;

   putimages(h2,img,j);
end;

closeimage(h);
closeimage(h2);
</PRE>

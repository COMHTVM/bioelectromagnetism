<TITLE>Speeding up MATLAB</TITLE>
<H2>Speeding up MATLAB</H2>

One of the frequent complaints that we hear from people just being
introduced to MATLAB is that it is terribly slow.  There <I>is</I> a
speed trade-off inherent in MATLAB.  Since it is an interpreted
language instead of a compiled language (such as C or FORTRAN), its
speed will almost always lag behind that of a custom program written
in a language like C.  However, this speed loss is made up for by the
ease of code development.

<P>
Fortunately, the speed of MATLAB can be increased significantly by
careful construction of the scripts.  There is one basic rule to
follow when writing a MATLAB script for speed:

<UL>
<LI> Under all circumstances, try to avoid the use of <TT>for</TT>
loops in MATLAB.
</UL>

This rule has a simple to remember corollary:

<UL>
<LI> Vectorize, vectorize, vectorize.
</UL>

In other words, whenever possible use vector operations.  For many
operations, with some thought applied to vectorization, code speed can
be increased by several orders of magnitude.  Unfortunately,
vectorization can be difficult for someone new to MATLAB to visualize.
Since most people are introduced to MATLAB after they already have a
familiarization with traditional programming languages, they tend to
use <TT>for</TT> loops automatically.

<P>
Let's consider a simple example.  We want to find how many points in
an image have a value greater than 2000.  In a traditional programming
language, we might take the following approach:

<PRE>
j=0;
for i=1:16384;
    if (PET(i)>2000)
        j=j+1;
    end
end
</PRE>

This takes about a second to execute under MATLAB.  A vectorized
approach is to use the MATLAB <TT>find</TT> function:

<PRE>
length(find(PET>2000));
</PRE>

This takes about 0.07 seconds to execute, and is therefore
approximately 15 times faster than the traditional approach.  Now,
consider the following related problem.  We wish to create a mask
based on the image we were just manipulating, where any point whose
value is greater than 2000 is set to one, and all other points are set
to zero.  The traditional solution to this might look something like:

<PRE>
mask=zeros(16384,1);
for i=1:16384;
    if (PET(i)>2000)
        mask(i)=1;
    end;
end;
</PRE>

This takes about 0.81 seconds to execute.  A faster, vectorized
approach is as follows:

<PRE>
mask2=zeros(16384,1);
index=find(PET>2000);
mask2(index)=ones(size(index));
</PRE>

This takes about 0.05 seconds to execute, and is therefore about 16
times faster than the traditional approach.  It also introduces an
important technique that is useful when vectorizing routines: using a
vector as an index to another vector.  In the above code fragment, the
variable <TT>index</TT> contains the indices of values.

<P>
One other thing to keep in mind when trying to speed up MATLAB code is
that it is possible to call FORTRAN or C routines from within MATLAB.
These functions are called either FMEX or CMEX functions depending on
which language they are written in, and details on creating them can
be found in the MATLAB External Interface Guide.

<P>
The EMMA toolbox contains several CMEX versions of popular MATLAB
functions:

<OL>

<LI> <TT>ntrapz</TT> is a replacement for the MATLAB <TT>trapz</TT>
trapezoidal integration function.

<LI> <TT>nfmins</TT> is a replacement for the MATLAB <TT>fmins</TT>
function minimization routine.

<LI> <CODE>lookup</CODE> performs 1-D linear interpolation, similar to
MATLAB's <CODE>interp1</CODE> routine.

<LI> <CODE>rescale</CODE> is useful for scaling a large matrix by a
constant, or by another matrix of the same size and shape.
<CODE>rescale</CODE> doesn't offer a significant speed advantage over
the <CODE>.*</CODE> operator, but it performs the arithmetic in place,
so no copy is made of the target matrix.  This can result in significant
memory savings.

  </OL>

These routines are functionally identical to the MATLAB routines, and
simply offer an increase in speed.

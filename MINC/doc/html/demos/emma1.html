<H1>Basic EMMA Image Manipulation</H1>

EMMA (Extensible Matlab Medical Analysis) is a general purpose toolkit
of MATLAB functions intended to help researchers with image analysis
performed under MATLAB.  It provides functions for reading MINC
(Medical Image Net CDF) files, writing MINC files, displaying images,
and performing general manipulations on images.

<H3>Reading in Images from File</H3>

<P> Let's start with a quick demonstration.  We will read in 21 frames
from a dynamic PET stored in a MINC file, and display one frame from
this data set.  First, we must open the file.  The EMMA function
<TT>openimage</TT> opens the image file for reading, and returns a
handle.  Therefore, we call it like this:

<PRE>
h=openimage('/local/matlab/toolbox/emma/examples/yates_19445.mnc');
</PRE>

The variable <TT>h</TT> is now the handle used for dealing with this
image file (its actual value is unimportant to the user).  Now that
the file is open, we can read it with the EMMA <TT>getimages</TT>
function.  We will read all 21 frames from slice 8 of the study:

<PRE>
PET=getimages(h,8,1:21);
</PRE>

The variable <TT>PET</TT> now contains the images for each frame of
slice 8.  We can see what variables we have and their sizes by using
the MATLAB <TT>whos</TT> command:

<PRE>
>> whos
              Name        Size       Elements     Bytes    Density   Complex

               PET   16384 by 21       344064   2752512       Full      No 
                 h       1 by 1             1         8       Full      No 

Grand total is 344065 elements using 2752520 bytes
</PRE>
The images themselves are 128 pixels by 128 pixels (16384 elements),
and are stored by EMMA in column form.  When the <TT>getimages</TT>
function reads in the image, it concatenates the lines of the image
together to form one column.  Therefore, the <TT>PET</TT> variable
read in previously contains 16384 rows (128x128=16384), and 21 columns
(21 images).  Although this may seem somewhat unwieldy at first, it
allows for efficient image manipulation under MATLAB.

<H3>Viewing an Image</H3>

<P>We may view one image from this data set by using the EMMA
<TT>viewimage</TT> function.  It takes an image stored in either
column format like that just described, or as a matrix, and displays
it in a figure window.  If we want to view the 17th image in the
variable <TT>PET</TT> (the seventeenth frame from the eighth slice of
the study opened previously), we want to view <TT>PET(:,17)</TT>,
since this will return all elements of the 17th column of the matrix
PET:

<PRE>
viewimage(PET(:,17));
</PRE>

This will produce an image that looks something like this:

<P><IMG SRC="emma1PET.gif">

<H3>Creating a New MINC File</H3>

<P>We may also create a new MINC file and write images into it, using
the EMMA <TT>newimage</TT> function.  If we wanted to save the
variable <TT>PET</TT> in a new MINC file called <TT>new.mnc</TT>, we
would first create the MINC file with the <TT>newimage</TT> function:

<PRE>
h2 = newimage('new.mnc', [21 1 128 128]);
</PRE>

Like the <TT>openimage</TT> function, <TT>newimage</TT> also returns a
handle to an open MINC file (this time the MINC file is open for
writing).  The above command creates a MINC file with 21 frames, 1
slice, and images that are 128x128.  When the file is created with
<TT>newimage</TT>, it is empty, and should be filled with images.
This can be done with the EMMA <TT>putimages</TT> function:

<PRE>
putimages(h2,PET,1,1:21);
</PRE>

This writes the 21 images in the variable PET into the MINC file
(represented by <TT>h2</TT>) as slice one, frames one through
twenty-one.

<H3>A More Complex Example</H3>

<P>Let's try something a little more involved.  We will take the
variable <TT>PET</TT> that we already read in from disk, integrate
each pixel over the frames (time), and write out the resulting image.
First, we require the mid-frame times for the 21 frames loaded.  We
can use the EMMA <TT>getimageinfo</TT> function to get this
information:

<PRE>
ftimes = getimageinfo(h,'MidFrameTimes');
</PRE>

This will create a new variable called <TT>ftimes</TT> that contains
the mid-frame times for each frame.  We may now integrate with the
EMMA <TT>ntrapz</TT> function (which has the same functionality as the
MATLAB <TT>trapz</TT> function, but performs its calculations an order
of magnitude more quickly):

<PRE>
img = ntrapz(ftimes,PET')';
</PRE>

We must transpose the <TT>PET</TT> variable before passing it to the
<TT>ntrapz</TT> function since <TT>ntrapz</TT> expects the second
variable to have the same number of rows as the first variable
(<TT>PET</TT> is 16384x21, so <TT>PET'</TT> is 21x16384, and
<TT>ftimes</TT> is 21x1, satisfying the requirement).  The answer must
also be transposed so that <TT>img</TT> is a column vector (not a row
vector) representation of the image. (<B>Note:</B> This example is
<I>not</I> the most memory efficient way to calculate the integrated
image.  Please consult <A HREF="matlab_memory.html"> Controlling
MATLAB Memory Use</A> for more information.)


<P>One might imagine a situation where we wanted to calculate the
integrated image for each slice in a study, and then write the result
into a new MINC file.  We would want the new MINC file to have the
same dimensional information as the original MINC file, except with no
frames.  This can be easily accomplished, since newimage allows the
specification of a "parent image" from which to take the required
dimensional information.  So, using the original MINC file as the
parent, we can create a new MINC file:

<PRE>
h3 = newimage('new2.mnc', [0 15], ...
     '/local/matlab/toolbox/emma/examples/yates_19445.mnc');
</PRE>

This new file contains no frames, fifteen slices, and the same spacing
as the parent image.  We could then write our integrated image into
this new MINC file using the <TT>putimages</TT> function:

<PRE>
putimages(h3,img,8);
</PRE>

This writes the data from the variable <TT>img</TT> into the MINC file
represented by the handle <TT>h3</TT> as slice 8 (remember that we
originally read the data from slice 8).  In order to write data for
every slice into the new MINC file, we would need to repeat the above
procedure (read, integrate, write result) for each slice.

At this stage, you may wish to move on to more complex image
manipulation.  If so, consult the <A HREF="emma2.html">advanced EMMA
image manipulation</A> demo.

<H2>Introduction</H2>

EMMA (Extensible MATLAB Medical image Analysis) is a toolkit written at
the Montreal Neurological Institute designed to ease the use of MATLAB
in the analysis of medical imaging data.  It was conceived by <A
HREF="/users/sean/">Sean Marrett</A> and implemented (in the summer of
1993) by <A HREF="/users/wolforth/">Mark Wolforth</A> and <A
HREF="/users/greg/">Greg Ward</A>, under Sean's guidance.

It provides functions for reading and writing <A
HREF="/software/minc/minc.html">MINC</A> files (our local data file
format), viewing images, performing ROI operations, and performing
several popular analyses.  Also, there are toolkits for performing
kinetic analysis of dynamic PET rCBF (regional cerebral blood flow)
and FDG data.

<LI> <A HREF="doc/emma/emma.html">
     <STRONG>General EMMA documentation</STRONG></A>:
Explains the use of the EMMA analysis package, with examples.

<LI> <A HREF="doc/rcbf/rcbf.html">
     <STRONG>Regional Cerebral Blood Flow (rCBF) Analysis</STRONG>:</A>
Explains the theory, implementation, and use of the EMMA RCBF toolkit,
with examples.  This is meant both as a usable application for
determining kinetic constants K1 and k2, and as an example of how to
write such applications with MATLAB and EMMA.

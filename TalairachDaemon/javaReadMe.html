        <p>The
Talairach Daemon Client will read tab or space delimited records from
text files containing lists of Talairach coordinates arranged in x-y-z
order. Or, using the Single Point Processing dialog, one can input in a
single coordinate to label. It will then look up the coordinate in the
Talairach Daemon database for the Talairach label. There are options to
search for the single point, search range or nearest gray matter. The
output is written to a file which can be viewed in the program, a
third-party text editor or imported into a third-party spreadsheet.</p>
        
        <h2>Installation</h2>
        
        <h3>Windows:</h3><br>
        <p>NOTE: Your computer must have a <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html">Java Virtual Machine</a> installed.</p>
         <ol>
         <li><a href="http://ric.uthscsa.edu/projects/tdc/downloads/win/TDClient.zip">Download</a> the software.
         </li><li>Install by double-clicking on the installer file, tdc.pkg. 
         </li></ol>

        <h3>Macintosh:</h3>
        <ol>
        <li><a href="http://ric.uthscsa.edu/projects/tdc/downloads/mac/TalairachDaemonClient.pkg.zip">Download</a> the software.
        </li><li>Double-click on the pkg file and following the installation instructions that follow.
        </li></ol>
        <p>NOTE:
The default installation directory is the system Applications
directory. You can also choose your installation directory during the
installation process.</p>
        
        <h3>Solaris:</h3>
        <ol>
        <li><a href="http://ric.uthscsa.edu/projects/tdc/downloads/solaris/TalairachDaemonClient.zip">Download</a> the software.</li>
        <li>Unzip the zip file.</li>
        <li>To run the program, change your current directory to the installation directory and type "tdc" at the command-line.</li>
        </ol>        
        
        <h2>Batch File Format</h2>
Before you begin searching you must create a text file with a list of
the x-y-z Talairach coordinates that you want to label. The file
"test.txt" is an example of the required format. The current version of
the TD Java Search client will read files containing up to 40,000
records (x-y-z coordinates).<br>
        
        <h2>General Instructions</h2>
        <b>Batch Processing:</b>
         <ol>
         <li>Once file(s) are created for batch processing, select your file(s) from the <b>File</b> menu. The number of coordinates will be printed in the information window.
        </li><li>Press
the "Process" button to begin. Several messages will be printed in the
information window to inform you of the file loading progress. A
progress bar is updated every 10th coordinate to give you an idea of
how long it will take to retrieve all of the labels. As each label is
retrieved it is appended to the output file along with the Talairach
coordinates. The output file will be created dependent on the input
file name (i.e. If your input file is test.txt, your output file will
be test.td. Note the different extensions.) </li><li>When all labels have been retrieved you are given
the option to view the result file in the program's text area. Also,
the result file can be viewed by any text editor or import it into a
spreadsheet. </li></ol>

         <b>Single Point Processing:</b>
         <ol>
         <li>From the <b>Option</b> menu, choose "Single Point Processing".  A dialog will appear.
        </li><li>Enter in your coordinates into the fields for x, y, and z.
        </li><li>Choose your options for processing (i.e. Single Point, Range Search or Nearest Gray Matter)
        </li><li>Choose
your options for saving to a file. If you want to save to a file, you
must check the checkbox and pick a file. The file will stay open for
writing as long as the Single Point Processing dialog is open. Once it
closes, the file is closed. If the dialog is opened again for
processing, you would need to pick another file for the next set of
processing or the program will write over the current file. </li><li>Click <b>Process</b> to process the point.
        </li></ol>

NUFFT - nonuniform FFT toolbox for Matlab
by Jeff Fessler and Brad Sutton

The interpolation methods have been optimized by a min-max criterion
that minimizes the worst-case error.

See "Nonuniform fast Fourier transforms using min-max interpolation"
by Jeff Fessler and Brad Sutton, to appear in IEEE Trans. Signal Processing.

This work was inspired by collaboration on MR imaging with Doug Noll.
For more details, look for MR-related papers on Fessler's web site:

The main routines are nufft1.m and nufft2.m, which each have
their own built-in "test" routine that illustrates example usage.

The routines in the "private" subdirectory are used by the routines
in this directory but are probably not useful otherwise.
Hiding them that way is a little-known but useful Matlab convention!

The very first version of these files was written by Brad Sutton:
	ir6:/x/bpsutton/Nufft
But they have evolved considerably since then.
